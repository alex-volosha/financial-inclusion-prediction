# Financial inclusion in Africa 
 Find a notebook where I demonstrate the way I created different machine learning models to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The models and solutions developed can provide insights into some of the key factors driving individualsâ€™ financial security.

The evaluation metric for this project is Mean Absolute error, where 1 indicates that the individual does have a bank account and 0 indicates that they do not.

Description of project workflow: 

1)Define client's case
2)Import data and perform exploratory analysis
3)Feature engineering
4)Build potential customers' profile
5)Hypothesis generation
6)Feature engineering
7)Training and comparing different machine learning models



## Requirements and Environment

Requirements:
- pyenv with Python: 3.11.3

Environment: 

For installing the virtual environment you can either use the Makefile and run `make setup` or install it manually with the following commands: 

```Bash
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

In order to train the model and store test data in the data folder and the model in models run:

```bash
#activate env
source .venv/bin/activate

python example_files/train.py  
```

In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python example_files/predict.py models/linear_regression_model.sav data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv
```
